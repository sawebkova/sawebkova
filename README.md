- 👋 Hi, I’m @sawebkova
- 👀 I’m interested in languages, yoga and website development 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the FEWD
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning more about GitHub and website creation baby-steps level  
- ⚡ Fun fact: website creation and coding are so far beyond anything I have ever done before that it makes it scary and exciting at the same time
