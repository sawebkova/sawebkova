## 👋 Hi, I’m **@sawebkova**
I’m interested in:
 * languages
 *  yoga
 * *website development*

🌱 I’m currently learning the __*FEWD*__  at San Diego Community College District  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning more about GitHub and website creation baby-steps level  
⚡ Fun fact: website creation and coding are so far beyond anything I have ever done before that it makes it scary and exciting at the same time
